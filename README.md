This software is related to the [SIFACIT project](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/activities/sifacit) and accompanies the article ["Multipoint Field-Aligned Current Estimates With Swarm"](https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JA026439) by A.

## Authors
 - Adrian Blagau (Institute for Space Sciences, Bucharest)
 - Joachim Vogt (Jacobs University Bremen) 

## TODO
 - Implement automated testing and generation of notebooks containing output cells using Treebeard - to be viewable at swarm-vre.readthedocs.io
 - Improvements to code organisation
 - Awaiting further inputs expected in Spring 2021
 - Add DOI through Zenodo
 - Add a mechanism within VRE to access this repo directly (maybe an extension to the launcher to provide nbgitpuller links to DISC-affiliated repos?)
